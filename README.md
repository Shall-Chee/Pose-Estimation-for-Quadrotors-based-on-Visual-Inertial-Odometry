# Pose Estimation for Quadrotors based on Visual Inertial Odometry
• Designed complementary filter for rotation estimation by combining accelerometer and gyro measurement.

• Built RANSAC-based stereo odometry system to estimate position and orientation of quadrotors.

• Applied Extended Kalman Filter in sensor fusion to estimate pose by using data from IMU and stereo pair.
